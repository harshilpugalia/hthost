<p>"I hate Samsung! It's a cheap plastic product besides everyone has it! I pity those Samsung device owners,they just manage to play Temple Run on the device!

I wonder how they gonna beat my score on my Apple iDevice [Sorry not gonna reveal it]", Those were my words when I visited a retail shop in 2011. <bold>Being an Apple Fan</bold> and a tech geek (yeah, since then), I completely ignored Samsung's existence in Samrtphone market and was just a commoner like other electronic OEMs.

Years passed and I moved onto LG Optimus device, it was the "NEW" in the market as one of the early phones to start dual-core phones and had more than standard  Android features (Yes, I moved, I cheated but that's OK). Evolving as a tech geek made me question the ability to tinker with Apple's system and it was suffocating being in a closed environement, which was very small now to contain me.

Before i could explore this one device, I had to part ways with it due to the Chennai floods that took place in November 2015 as it got washed away.  It was a sad time but by now I was "converted" one and all my love for Apple and hatred for Samsung was already done with. And that year already witnessed the corner stone from Samsung, the Galaxy S6|Edge|Edge+ and it was enough to pull me in, and i said to my friend in college, "That I want to own one such device!!". Being very tight on budget, I settled for Galaxy On5. Just because it's similarity to Samsung's theme and the Display ofcourse.

You guessed it right, that's where kickstarted my journey as a Galaxy User!</p>
